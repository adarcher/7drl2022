# 7DRL: 2022

A casual entry to the 2022 7DRL challenge

https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2022

### Challenge Summary

Spend at most 7 days (168 hours) creating a non-prototype of a new rogue-like game.

2022, March 5th - 13th

### My Goals

I am still recovering from major burnout so I don't expect to have a completely polished game, but I plan to have an attempt to finish a project.

I'll only spend 3-4 hours a day and don't mind starting a little "late" compared to others.  

I've wanted to join the challenge for many years and I've had many ideas to try out.  One of the most commonly thought of ones is to create a homage to the SMT: Persona series in RL fashion--that's the design goal for this attempt.

I use the word attempt because, mentally, I'm still fragile to deadlines/restraints and I don't want to add distracting stress to this project.


Here is a basic rundown of my plan.

|       | Date             | Main Goal        |
| ----- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Day 1 | Mon. March 7th   | Render tile-grid |
| Day 2 | Tues, March 8th  | World generation |
| Day 3 | Wed, March 9th   | Combat           |
| Day 4 | Thur, March 10th | Fusing           |
| Day 5 | Fri, March 11th  | Dialog           |
| Day 6 | Sat, March 12th  | Polish           |
| Day 7 | Sun, March 13th  | Finalize game    |
