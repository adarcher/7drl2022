### Challenge Summary

Spend at most 7 days (168 hours) creating a non-prototype of a new rogue-like game.

2022, March 5th - 13th

### My Goals

I am still recovering from major burnout so I don't expect to have a completely polished game, but I plan to have an attempt to finish a project.

I'll only spend 3-4 hours a day and don't mind starting a little "late" compared to others.  

I've wanted to join the challenge for many years and I've had many ideas to try out.  One of the most commonly thought of ones is to create a homage to the SMT: Persona series in RL fashion--that's the design goal for this attempt.

I use the word attempt because, mentally, I'm still fragile to deadlines/restraints and I don't want to add distracting stress to this project.


Here is a basic rundown of my plan.

|                        | Date             | Main Goal        | Achieved |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| [Day 1](./doc/day1.md) | Mon. March 7th   | Render tile-grid | yup      |
| [Day 2](./doc/day2.md) | Tues, March 8th  | World generation | no       |
| [Day 3](./doc/day3.md) | Wed, March 9th   | Combat           | yup      |
| [Day 4](./doc/day4.md) | Thur, March 10th | Fusing           | no       |
| [Day 5](./doc/day5.md) | Fri, March 11th  | Dialog           | no       |
| [Day 6](./doc/day6.md) | Sat, March 12th  | Polish           | no       |
| [Day 7](./doc/day7.md) | Sun, March 13th  | Finalize game    | no       |

### Final Thoughts

On the whole, I'm proud of what I was able to get done.  I spent around 18-21 hours on this project and in the end I've got something usable, that I can expand on later if I want to.  I spent the majority of the time looking up minor language paradims that I found interesting: compositing, tile rendering, fps throttling within the browser, mixins, etc.

I may come back to the project just to do some retrospective.

I've made a lot of progress with my mental health and this gives me hope to keep improving.  I'll continue to take Baby Steps towards my goal of improved confidence and productivity.
