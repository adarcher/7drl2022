### Day 5 Log, March 11th 2022

- Original Goal: Dialog
- Goal: Enemies

I'm wearing out and I don't know if I'll be able to keep even this slow pace up.

I plan to get at least some movement into an enemy and some test combat in place.  It will be ripped out at some point, but just messing with states and rendering will be the more interesting tasks today.

I ended up getting most of the way through getting some test interactions and then wiping myself out.

- [x] Simple attack
- [x] Simple death state for enemies
- [ ] Player stats and demon catalog
