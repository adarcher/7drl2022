- Goal: Render tile-grid

I gave myself a very small goal today to start.  It's something I've done before and should be able to get up without too much trouble.

I wasted multiple hours of time looking into tilesets.  In hindsight, I should have done some prepwork for the project, but I convinced myself to do the complete game as a whole, without too much planning beforehand. 

I finally found a simple ASCII tileset to use.  I wanted something that was just basic and not graphical; I chose the original IBM BIOS VGA font and eventually found someone who rendered out the glyphs in a 16x16-tile image.

I went home to no internet, so my development time got cut short.

I made a blank canvas and got the math correct to copy a single glyph from a tileset into the main rendering frame.
