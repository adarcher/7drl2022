### Day 2 Log, March 8th 2022

- Goal: World generation 

Each day has "small" goals, but ramping up.  World generation isn't really a small goal, but not much is needed to actually qualify as a world.  So, I'm hoping for just random renderable data in a grid.  I spend time later, making it structured.

The lofty goal was to have a maze generator, but that didn't happen.  I did get the grid up and then added onto the renderer to have a render loop and a fps display using the tileset.
