- Goal: Combat

I don't think I'll get to combat today.  But, I'll do my best.  The renderer needs some more work and the world isn't much at all.

I need to split the renderer into layers for background->foreground for fast compositing.  I spent some time yesterday looking into avoiding that, but it's not easily possible.

I didn't do any combat.  I had a relaxing time just looking into the background/foreground layering and then capping the framerate.

I'm hoping I don't just end up making this a simple tile rendering project, heh.
